        <h1><span class="blog__special">Final</span> Release.</h1>
        <h2 class="blog__large">Published: Oct 7, 2024</h2>
        <p class="blog__small">
          After a ton of hard work, deliberation, and a lot of learning, I am finally happy to announce that my password manager called
		  RandPyPwMan (at the present... not overly attached to that name) is nearly complete. It has been a multi-year passion project that has been
		  on-going since its inception way back in November 6, 2021. At the time, I had only wanted to create a random password generator. Having,
		  been fed up with the LastPass Password generator, and the strange quirks it used to have (I am unsure if these quirks are still present)...
          
          <br><br>
          
          Currently, the software is in v0.8.6, growing in both lines of code and complexity as the version number grew. With each new build
		  bringing a new edition, like a database, new features like importing passwords from other systems, and various other things. The next version will 
		  likely be the software's v1.0.0 release, which is NOT the final release. But, it is the first fully fledged release for the software, which
		  is very exciting to see! I have also had a ton of help on this project, from friends who have helped with either bits of code, ideas, 
		  bug-testing, and documentation. Without them, this may have even taken longer than it has already!
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  The intention with this product was never to rival BitWarden, or any of the other large password managers. This idea was more for fun,
		  and to serve as a proof-of-concept to myself. That I can achieve more than I think I may be capable of, even if it may take a few years
		  of planning/hard work. My end goal for this project was always to build a software which was usable, user friendly, and robust. And so far,
		  through this project, I believe I have achieved exactly that. As this project wraps up to a close, I am very happy with the way it has all
		  transpired. I will continue to support this password manager moving forward, but very likely, step back, and begin working on other projects.
		  I do not intend to drop support for this, but only to shift my focus onto other more current projects. If you have any questions about the
		  software, or issues, please reach out to me via GitHub or send me an email at contact@haydenhildreth.com.
		  
		  <br><br>

		  Thank you all!
